# One-Mind-for-Snes9x
A simple programm written in C# which switches controls between player1 and player2 via Snes9x's integrated function 'joypad swap' in a random point in time between a certain range of time. Plays a sound warning before doing so. Try to beat a 1-player snes game with 2 Joypads and your friend ;)
